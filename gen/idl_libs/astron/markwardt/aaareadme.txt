The procedures in this directory are a subset of the IDL program developed by
Craig Markwardt (NASA/GSFC).   They are duplicated here because they are used by
other procedures in the Astronomy library, but they are *not* included in the
.tar or .zip distributions of the Astronomy library.   Users must either
separately download the procedures in this directory, or download the entire 
Markwardt library from http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/idl.html

MPFIT() -  Perform Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization 
MPFIT2dFUN - Perform Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares fit to a 2-D IDL function

The procedures are required by solve_astro.pro
