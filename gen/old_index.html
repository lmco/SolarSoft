<h2>What is SolarSoft?</h2>
The SolarSoft system is a set of integrated software libraries,  data bases,
and system utilities which provide a  common programming and data analysis 
environment for Solar Physics.  The SolarSoftWare (SSW) system is built
from Yohkoh, SOHO, SDAC and <a href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html"><em>Astronomy</em></a> libraries and draws upon contributions 
from many members of those projects.  It is primarily an 
 <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/"><em>IDL</em></a> based 
system, although some instrument teams integrate executables 
written in other languages.   
The SSW environment provides a consistent look and 
feel at widely distributed co-investigator institutions to facilitate data 
exchange and to stimulate coordinated analysis.  
Commonalities and overlap in solar data and analysis goals are exploited 
to permit application of fundamental utilities to the data from many 
different solar instruments.  The use of common libraries, utilities, 
techniques and interfaces minimzies the learning curve for investigators 
who are analyzing new solar data sets, correlating results from multiple 
experiments or performing research away from their home institution.

<dl><em><b>Some of the primary goals of the SSW are...</b></em><p>
<dt><b>Provide a large reuse SW library</b>
<dd>The software library represents an evolutionary system
    tracing back to SMM, through Yohkoh and SOHO, TRACE, and eventually will
    incorporate SXI, HESSI, and other solar observatories.
    Many common "solar physics" , file i/o, system, IDL structure
    manipulation, data display, etc. tasks have already been addressed
    by others (many others in some cases!)<br>

   <ul> <em>Very small sample of existing SSW capabilities...</em><br>
    <li> Time series analysis, time conversions, <b>UTPLOT</b> <em> (millennium safe)</em>
    <li> Spectral fitting 
    <li> Image and Image cube (movies) display
    <li> IDL data manipulation (structure, string, array, mathematics...) 
    <li> File I/O (generic binary, ascii), FITS
    <li> Solar (limb fitting, grid overlay, coordinate tranformations...)
    <li> WWW related (html conversion, file conversions, FORM handling, 
         <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_movie_making.html"> movie making</a>,...)
    <li> WWW Client<-><em><b>SolarSoft IDL server</b></em> interface
         permits execution of SSW/IDL utilities over the Web <br>
         Examples include <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/YPOP/sxt_movie.html">
	 SXT dynamic WWW movie maker</a> and 
	 <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/SXT/plot_goes.html"> 
	 WWW GOES X-Ray light curve display</a>
	 
    </ul><br>
<a href="http://soho01.nascom.nasa.gov/~soho/ssw_cat"> 
WWW index which allows searching for SSW routines by category 
and/or string pattern</a> is available.

<dt><b>Provide a system which is largely hardware-system and site
independent</b>
<dd>Installation and setup utilities simplify tranportation to systems.
    Fundamental shared software is written in hardware-independent and 
    site-configuration independent form.  The SSW setup utilities support
    local configuration files to get sites up and running
<dt><b>Promote the use of certain standards which facilitate coordinated
data analysis </b>
<dd>Through use of suggested standards, many powerful routines are 
immediately available for the analysis of new data sets.  <br>The
<a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_standards.html"><em><b>SSW</b>suggested Keywords and Tags</em> </a> 
descibes pointing and time standards.  <br><font color=red> Application  for 
overlay, alignment, scaling, rotation, etc of any SSW instruments
via Dominic Zarro's <a href="http://orpheus.nascom.nasa.gov/~zarro/idl/maps.html"><em>Mapping</em> software</a></font>
<dt><b>Promote an evolutionary environment</b>
<dd>Feedback and contributions from the many SSW institutes and users 
are strongly encouraged. Utilties to simplify remote 
<a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ssw_upgrades.html">SSW upgrades</a>
and accept user contribution are designed to make the system 
evolutionary instead of stagnant and divergent.

<dt><b>Provide access to supporting ancillary data bases</b>
<dd> Access to supporting data sets from ground-based and satellite-based
solar observatories are provided in consistent formats to facilitate
coordinated analysis

<dt><b>Provide a file-format independent analysis environment</b>
<dd> To accomodate the largest number of solar data sets, 
file I/O is isolated and analysis applications are designed to operate
on objects which are independent of file type.  

<dt><b>Provide integrated access to other IDL <em>packages</em></b>
<dd> When IDL libraries are identified which provide a  useful extension to 
SSW capabilities, we will attempt to integrate them into the SSW system.  
For example, the <a href="packages/SSW_Packages_Chianti.html"><em>
Chianti Package, K. Dere et al.</em></a>
is now fully integrated into the SSW distribution and analysis environment
for UV/EUV emission line analysis.

<h3> A "typical" SSW installation is looks something like...</h3>
<pre>
			SSW
			|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	 |	  |			       |		       |                       |
SITE    GEN	  SOHO			       YOHKOH              (...missions...)    (...packages...)
	(SSW)	  |			       |                   
		  -------------------- 	       ------------------
		  |    |   |     |    |        |    |   |   |   |
		  GEN  EIT LASCO CDS  [etc]    GEN  SXT BCS HXT WBS
		 (soho)                      (yohkoh)

</pre>

The "GEN" branches contain general purpose (IDL, setup) which are applicable to 
branches below - thus the SSW-GEN contains globally useful routines 
(instrument/mission independent)   and the MISSION-GEN contain routines which 
are mission dependent but may be used by all instruments within the mission
(mission pointing, epehermeris, etc).  The SITE directory is available 
for local SW and definition of SSW environmentals/logicals in terms of 
local pathnames.
<p>
The SSW installation procedure and system design allows local configurations 
which contain a subset of this tree - thus, an <em>EIT/SXT/Chianti
<b>only</b></em> installation is ok
and would look like...
<pre>
		SSW
                |
-------------------------------------------------
|       |       |               |                | 
SITE	GEN 	SOHO		YOHKOH           PACKAGES
		|               |                | 
		----		----             Chianti
		|   |		|   |
		GEN EIT		GEN SXT

</pre>

SSW setup startup utilities define the IDL environment based upon users
SSW instrument selection. (not shown are links to Astronomy and other 
IDL libraries which are added by the SSW startup)
