Solar Flare Finder is an interactive widget to search for solar flares
observed by various combinations of space-based solar observatories.
The code searches a pre-generated text file for all GOES events from
1-May-2010 until the most recent update (i.e. since the launch of SDO).
It uses Sam Freeland's SSW Latest Events list from the HEK which
supplies flare locations using AIA 131A images.
It is assumed that AIA and HMI were observing continuously.

The filenames listed after performing a search contain the following
information: (e.g., 20140204_152500_M1_hsi100_megsab_eis_sot_xrt_iris.png)
"20140204_152500" = GOES start time/SOL number
"M1" = GOES class
"hsi100" = RHESSI observed 100% of the GOES rise phase
"megsab_eis_sot_xrt_iris" = flare was also observed by MEGS-A and -B,
all 3 Hinode instruments and IRIS.

The plots shown after selecting a given filename include:
1) The GOES X-ray (black) and Lya (grey, when available) lightcurves with 
the timing of Hinode, SDO/EVE, and IRIS observations overlaid
2) RHESSI lightcurves up to the maximum energy detected
3) An SDO/AIA 131A (or Proba2/SWAP 171A or XRT), full-disk image with
the fields of view of the Hinode and IRIS instruments overlaid. The
white circle denotes the flare location from AIA images. RHESSI
contours are overlaid in black if available. These may not always agree.

Optional search criteria include:
GOES Class: B, C, M, X, or All.

RHESSI coverage: >0% or >90% of the rise phase of the flare as determined
by the duration that the RHESSI flare flag was active between the GOES
start and peak times. Or no preference.

RHESSI max. energy: the maximum energy detected by RHESSI as noted in
the RHESSI flare list. Or no preference.

SDO/AIA location: On disk (>-600"/<+600") or near the limb (<-600"/>+600"), or
no preference.

Hinode/EIS: If any EIS raster overlapped with the GOES event time, and
the AIA flare location was within the EIS FOV, then all EIS rasters within 
-30/+60 minutes of the GOES start/end time are shown.
(uses EIS_LIST_RASTER.PRO)

Hinode/SOT: If any SOT image was taken within the GOES event time, and
the AIA flare location was within the SOT FOV, then all SOT images within 
-30/+60 minutes of the GOES start/end time are shown.
(uses SOT_CAT.PRO)

Hinode/XRT: If any XRT image was taken within the GOES event time, and
the AIA flare location was within the XRT FOV, then all XRT images within 
-30/+60 minutes of the GOES start/end time are shown.
(uses XRT_CAT.PRO)

EVE MEGS-A: MEGS-A was assumed to have been observing continuously
from 1-May-2010 until it suffered a power anomaly on
26-May-2014. However, flares ~<C5 may not be apparent in the actual data.

EVE MEGS-B: MEGS-B data have been taken intermittently since SDO was
launched due to unforeseen detector degradation. Times for which
MEGS-B was exposed for periods of >1 hour are listed at
http://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/data_access/evewebdata/interactive/megsb_daily_exposure_hours.html
Flares are listed for which MEGS-B was exposed continuously during the
GOES rise phase.

IRIS: Uses the HEK to search for IRIS studies that overlap with the
GOES events times.
(uses IRIS_OBS2HCR.PRO)
