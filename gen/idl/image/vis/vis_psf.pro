; Project:
;   Gen/Image
; Name:
;   VIS_PSF
; Purpose:
;   This procedure makes and optionally displays a backprojection map from a visibility bag for
;   a unit delta function input, i.e. this is the point spread function backprojection map
; Calling Sequence:
;  vis_psf, vis, xypsf,  pixel=pixel, psf00=psf00, image_dim=image_dim, init=init, $
;    UNIFORM_WEIGHTING=uniform_weighting, spatial_frequency_weight =spatial_frequency_weight, $
;    _extra=_extra

; Inputs:
; Vis - visibility bag.  See {hsi_vis} for a compliant structure, must have
;   fields,  u, v, and obsvis
; xypsf - 1d index of location of psf in FOV or a 2d index such that the lower left hand corner has
;   a 1d index of 0 and 2d of [0,0] while the center of a 65x65 fov the center is at 32*65+32 or [32,32]
; 
; Outputs:
; Returns a flat array back projection map for input 
;   Overall normalization is arbitrary.
; Keywords
; image_dim - 1 or 2d vector with image dimensions, only first element is used for square fov
;   image_dim is forced to be an odd number 
; INIT - If set, forces the recalculation of PSF00, the base point spread function to be reused by shifting
; PSF00 - Base point spread function computed at the center of the FOV using the input weighting parameters
;   and meant to be reused by shifting. It is not automatically recomputed if the FOV or weighting params
;   are changed but this must be done by setting INIT. PSF00 is meant to be reused within a CLEAN loop and
;   so the visibilities, weighting, fov, pixel size and all other parameters than could affect the PSF
;   will remain unchanged.
; ALT_SHAPE_PSF - non-delta function (finite width) axially symmetric shape to use as psf basis.
;   Can be used with pixon-like (parabolic) and gaussian profiles  
; QUIET - (Through vis_bpmap) 1 or 0 If set suppresses  output to the screen, default is set
; NOPLOT - (Through vis_bpmap) 1 or 0 If set suppresses plot output, default is set

; 
; LABEL - (Through vis_bpmap) plot title (Default is current time.), string
; UNIFORM_WEIGHTING, (Through vis_bpmap) 1 or 0, if set, changes subcollimator weighting from default (NATURAL) to UNIFORM
;   setting to 0 uses NATURAL weighting, either sets SPATIAL_FREQUENCY_WEIGHT, default is 0, NATURAL
;   which gives equal weight to each subcollimator
; 
; SPATIAL_FREQUENCY_WEIGHT - (Through vis_bpmap) weighting for each collimator, set by UNIFORM_WEIGHTING if used
; The number of weights should either equal the number of unique sub-collimators or the number of visibilities
;   Also, the default RHESSI case is supported, passing 9 weights and the ones for each sc are selected from those
; LOOPSTYLE- for debugging, if set supports original style of bp computation in hsi_vis_bpmap, default is 0
; History
; 11-jun-2013, richard.schwartz@nasa.gov, developed to support vis_clean
; 18-jul-2013, richard.schwartz@nasa.gov, fixed bug from xyshift within init block
;     identified by Florian Mayer
; 22-oct-2013, richard.schwartz@nasa.gov, added alt_shape_psf to facilitate processing pixon(parabolic)
;   or Gaussians of finite width as the basis function instead of using a delta function
; 24-oct-2013, richard.schwartz@nasa.gov, increase fov to twice the normal fov to remove edge effects
; 13-mar-2023, kim.tolbert@nasa.gov, correct spelling of spatial_frequency_weight keyword (was
;   spatial_freqency_weight), and pass spatial_frequency_weight and uniform_weighting to vis_bpmap
